# Pong game

**```This is a personal project for learning purposes```**

This is a little project I did using [p5.js](https://p5js.org) JavaScript library to mimic the game designed during the [Pong lecture](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/weeks/0/) from the [CS50 introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/) course.

For learning purposes, I did a few changes like generating a random number for the ball angle instead of a random number for the x and y components. Also, every time any paddle collides with the ball, the speed from both paddle increases.
